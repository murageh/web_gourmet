# Web Gourmet

# Description
Web Gourmet is a web application that allows users to input a website URL, then proceed to ask any questions they may
have about the website.
The application will then provide a response to the user's question. The application is built
using the Django framework and the Python programming language.
The application uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the website and extract the information needed to answer
the user's question. The application leverages the power of AI for the question-answering functionality.
The frontend application is built using Next.js and TypeScript.
This is achieved using the embedded-search capabilities of openAI's GPT models.
